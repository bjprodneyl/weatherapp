 Welcome to my weather app
    ----------------------------------------------------------------- 


Hi there! Welcome to Rodney's Weather App!

I plan to make several versions of this weather app based on various javascrpt libraries. 

1) Weather App 1.0 - 1st version is jQuery powered

2) Weather App 1.0 - 1st version is Vanilla Javascript(ES2016) powered


3) Weather App 1.0 - 1st version is VueJS powered

So in the build out of this 1st version of the app. I focused on jQuery based solution.
There were a few hurdles I had to overcome with CORS and cross domain security in the 
browser, but once I resolved that, it was simply a matter of securing blocks of time to
flush out the logic. Moving forward I expect to make the display of all the days of the 
individual forecasts dynamic, as well as allow the user to add and remove cities.
